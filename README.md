# README for SPC6G Simulation and Analysis

## Overview

This project is based on the research paper titled **"SPC6G: Towards Efficient Resource Allocation in 6GV2X Networks: A Smart Predictive Collision Framework"**. The project provides analytical and simulation-based tools to evaluate the performance of the SPC6G and NRV2X protocols using Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and Packet Inter-Reception Rate (PIR) metrics. The analysis spans urban and highway scenarios.

## Structure

### 1. **Key Files**

- **`calculations.py`**: Core functions to calculate analytical and simulation-based metrics such as PRR, PIR, overlap probability, and resource utilization.
- **`analytical_prr_pir.py`**: Contains methods for computing PRR and PIR analytically across various distances and configurations.
- **`visualization_analtical_simulations.py`**: Visualizes the comparison between analytical and simulation results for metrics like PRR and PIR.
- **`visualization_simulations_highway.py`**: Plots PRR and PIR for highway simulation scenarios.
- **`visualization_simulations_urban.py`**: Plots PRR and PIR for urban simulation scenarios.

### 2. **Datasets**

- **`analytical_simulation_metrics.csv`**: Stores analytical PRR and PIR results.
- **`sim_metrics_data.csv`**: Simulated data for general scenarios.
- **`sim_metrics_data_highway.csv`**: Simulated data for highway scenarios.
- **`sim_metrics_data_urban.csv`**: Simulated data for urban scenarios.

### 3. **Notebooks**

- **`main.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook for integrating and running analytical calculations and visualizations interactively.
